# autotrader-scraper
Using the scraper from @liudvikasakelis as a basis to scrape data from USA-based autotrader listings, with the goal of measuring price history over the course of the next few months.

As the original repo is over 8 years old, it's likely that a majority of the codebase won't work anymore, simply because autotrader has changed their site layouts multiple times, even in the last year (I would know, I've spent a shameful amount of time using the app just for window shopping)

Anyways
